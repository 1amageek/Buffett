## What Works

- Real-time data fetching from kabu Station API is functional
- Basic technical indicators calculation implemented
- Swift Charts visualizations display data correctly
- Modular architecture with Swift Package Manager setup

## What's Left to Build

- Additional technical indicators and analysis tools
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- UI improvements for better user experience and accessibility
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Current Status

- Stable alpha version with core features implemented
- Ongoing development focused on feature completeness and robustness

## Known Issues

- Occasional latency in data updates under heavy load
- Limited support for multi-platform deployment
- Need for improved caching strategies to optimize performance
## What Works

* Initial setup of Swift Package Manager (SPM) structure and integration of Swift OpenAPI Generator
* Basic Swift Package definition for SBIStockAPI integration

## What's Left to Build

* API integration logic using the generated Swift OpenAPI client
* Calculation logic for technical indicators
* Visualization logic using Swift Charts
* Comprehensive error handling and UI feedback mechanisms

## Current Status

* Project structure and core dependencies established
* Ready to start active API integration and technical computation implementation

## Known Issues

* None currently identified

## Evolution of Project Decisions

* Transitioned to using Swift OpenAPI Generator for clarity, maintainability, and robustness in API integration
