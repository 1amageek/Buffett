# Progress for Buffett Application

## What Works

* Core project specifications and architecture defined.
* Initial data models and API wrappers for key RSS endpoints (Market, TickList, Chart) created.
* Basic charting components implemented using Swift Charts.
* Modular project structure with separation of API and UI logic established.
* Unit testing framework set up and initial tests written.
* Reactive data flow using Combine and async/await integrated.

## Whatâ€™s Left to Build

* Complete API wrappers for all remaining RSS endpoints.
* Full implementation of ViewModels for data binding and business logic.
* UI components for stock lists, categories, and multi-window chart views.
* Technical indicator calculation modules and integration with charts.
* Annotation and canvas features for user analysis.
* Performance optimization for handling large numbers of stocks and indicators.
* Comprehensive unit and UI testing coverage.
* Error handling and retry mechanisms for API communication.

## Current Status

* Early development phase with foundational components in place.
* Active focus on API integration and charting features.
* Testing and performance considerations ongoing.

## Known Issues

* Polling strategy and data throttling need refinement for scalability.
* UI responsiveness under heavy data load requires optimization.
* Annotation feature design and implementation pending.
