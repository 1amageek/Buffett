## Description of Flow

1. **User Launches Buffett App**: The app starts and initializes the necessary ViewModels following the MVVM pattern.
2. **Initialize ViewModels**: ViewModels prepare to manage data and business logic.
3. **Establish Connection to Rakuten Securities MarketSpeed II API (RSS)**: Using the Swift OpenAPI generated client, the app connects to the local MarketSpeed II RSS interface.
4. **Fetch Real-Time Market Data**: The app requests real-time stock data, respecting API rate limits and subscription constraints.
5. **Process and Store Data in Repository**: Data is managed via the repository pattern for clean separation and reusability.
6. **Calculate Technical Indicators**: On-device calculations of indicators like moving averages, RSI, etc.
7. **Update Observable Data Models**: Using Combine, data changes propagate reactively to the UI.
8. **Render Data Visualizations with Swift Charts**: The UI layer renders charts and visual elements for user insights.
9. **User Interacts with UI**: Users can navigate, select stocks, and request different views.
10. **Handle User Inputs and Requests**: Inputs trigger data refreshes or UI updates.
11. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures user-friendly messages on API failures or data issues.

This flow respects the modular architecture, MVVM design, and reactive programming principles outlined in the memory bank. It also aligns with the current work focus and next steps.

Please review this flow and let me know if you want me to proceed with implementing the components accordingly.
